# NBA_Draft_Model_1.0

Original NBA Draft Model (3/6/18). Results and a brief methodology can be found here: https://medium.com/ninety-four-by-fifty/2018-nba-draft-model-1-0-26a3670e4c4c

In this repository contains data (will not be updated), web scrapers for finding up to date data, and the R file for data cleaning, modeling, and simulation. The data source has since been disabled. Check my blog (https://medium.com/ninety-four-by-fifty) or my github page for future versions of this model, up-to-date data sources, and more.

Feel free to reach out with questions on data, coding, and the statistical modeling at aepowell95@gmail.com
